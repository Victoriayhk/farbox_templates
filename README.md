farbox_templates
================


About
-----
This project is about jinja2 templates for my [farbox blog](http://yih.farbox.com). 
this is Jinja2 syntax, besides farbox, other blog platform with Jinja2 templates can work too.

To use these templates, take farbox for example, you can copy the template folder and put it under your XXX.farbox.com folder, then set your `Template Priority` to `Custom Template`. make sure the template folder name should just be **template**.

Details
-------
this part is some description of each template. when using anyone of them, rename the folder to **template**.

### html5 UP - Alpha
this template comes from [html5 UP](http://html5up.net/), and currently the only template in this project. a little adjust was made to fix into farbox blog.

for better using, [google code prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/wiki/GettingStarted) JavaScript added. 
The codes(C++, Python, html, etc.) you post will look more beautiful than default template.

currently, [my own blog](http://yih.farbox.com) is using this template.
